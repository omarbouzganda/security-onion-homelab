# Security Onion Homelab

## Project Overview

The Security Onion Homelab project is designed to provide a comprehensive and effective security monitoring solution for home networks. It leverages various open-source tools and technologies to develop a structured environment for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats.  

### Goals
- To educate users on security monitoring techniques.  
- To deploy a user-friendly interface for monitoring network traffic.  
- To integrate various security tools for comprehensive threat detection.

### Features  
- **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**: Collect, analyze, and respond to security incidents while utilizing tools like Suricata and Zeek.  
- **Log Management**: Store and manage logs using Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for analysis and visualization.  
- **Intrusion Detection**: Detect potential security breaches using predefined rules and anomaly detection.

### Tools Used  
- **Security Onion**: A Linux distribution for intrusion detection, network security monitoring, and log management.
